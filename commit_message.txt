feat: increase description field validation limit to 50000 characters

- Updated Epic model description validation from max=5000 to max=50000
- Updated UserStory model description validation from max=2000 to max=50000  
- Added validation to Requirement model description field (max=50000)
- Updated service layer request structures with new limits:
  - CreateEpicRequest and UpdateEpicRequest
  - CreateUserStoryRequest and UpdateUserStoryRequest
- Updated documentation comments and @MaxLength annotations
- All tests pass successfully

This change addresses the issue where existing records in the database 
exceeded the previous validation limits (e.g., EP-176 with 10,471 characters).
The new 50,000 character limit provides sufficient space for detailed 
descriptions while maintaining reasonable constraints.

Database schema remains unchanged as PostgreSQL TEXT fields already 
support unlimited length. Only application-level validation was updated.
