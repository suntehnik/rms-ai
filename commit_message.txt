feat: register PAT routes in server configuration with middleware chain and rate limiting

- Add PAT routes to /api/v1/pats endpoint group with proper authentication
- Implement rate limiting middleware for PAT endpoints (10 requests/minute)
- Configure PAT middleware to support both PAT and JWT authentication
- Initialize PAT service and handler with secure token generator and bcrypt hash service
- Add PersonalAccessToken repository to repositories struct
- Create rate limiting middleware with configurable limits and time windows
- Support PAT creation, listing, and revocation endpoints with proper middleware chain

Requirements addressed:
- 4.1: POST /api/v1/pats endpoint for token creation
- 4.2: GET /api/v1/pats endpoint for listing user tokens  
- 4.3: DELETE /api/v1/pats/{id} endpoint for token revocation
- 4.6: Proper authentication middleware chain for PAT endpoints
- 5.6: Rate limiting protection for PAT endpoints (10 requests/minute)

Technical implementation:
- Created PATRateLimit middleware with in-memory rate limiter
- Integrated PAT middleware for dual authentication support (PAT + JWT)
- Added repository initialization in dependency injection
- Configured proper middleware chain: authentication -> rate limiting -> handlers
