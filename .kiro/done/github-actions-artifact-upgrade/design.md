# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the upgrade of deprecated GitHub Actions `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to the latest stable version `actions/upload-artifact@v4`. The upgrade involves updating two instances in the test strategy workflow and fixing one incomplete version reference. The design ensures backward compatibility while leveraging the improved security and performance features of v4.

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis
- **File**: `.github/workflows/test-strategy.yml`
- **Deprecated instances**: 2 occurrences of `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
- **Broken reference**: 1 incomplete version reference `actions/upload-artifact@v`
- **Affected jobs**: `e2e-tests` and `performance-tests`

### Target State
- All `upload-artifact` actions upgraded to `@v4`
- Consistent version referencing throughout the workflow
- Maintained functionality for artifact uploads and downloads
- No breaking changes to existing artifact consumption patterns

## Components and Interfaces

### GitHub Actions Workflow Components

#### E2E Test Artifact Upload
- **Location**: `e2e-tests` job, step "Upload E2E test results"
- **Current**: `actions/upload-artifact@v` (incomplete)
- **Target**: `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- **Artifacts**: Test logs and results from `*.log` and `test-results/`

#### Performance Test Artifact Upload
- **Location**: `performance-tests` job, step "Upload benchmark results"
- **Current**: `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
- **Target**: `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- **Artifacts**: Benchmark files from `*.bench` and `benchmark-results/`

### Version Compatibility Matrix
| Action Version | Node.js Runtime | Security Features | Performance |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| v3 (deprecated) | Node 16 | Basic | Standard |
| v4 (current) | Node 20 | Enhanced | Improved |

## Data Models

### Artifact Configuration Schema
```yaml
- name: Upload [artifact-type] results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: always()  # Ensure artifacts are uploaded even on failure
  with:
    name: [artifact-name]
    path: |
      [file-patterns]
    retention-days: [optional-retention-period]
```

### Migration Mapping
```yaml
# Before (v3)
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
with:
  name: artifact-name
  path: file-path

# After (v4) - Direct replacement
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
with:
  name: artifact-name
  path: file-path
```

## Error Handling

### Upgrade Risks and Mitigations

#### Breaking Changes Assessment
- **Risk**: v4 may have different behavior than v3
- **Mitigation**: GitHub maintains backward compatibility for basic usage patterns
- **Validation**: Test workflow execution after upgrade

#### Artifact Accessibility
- **Risk**: Existing artifact consumers may not work with v4 artifacts
- **Mitigation**: v4 maintains same artifact storage format and access patterns
- **Validation**: Verify artifact download functionality remains intact

#### Workflow Syntax Errors
- **Risk**: Incomplete version reference causes workflow failures
- **Mitigation**: Use complete version specification (`@v4`)
- **Validation**: GitHub workflow syntax validation

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep original workflow file as backup
- If issues arise, revert to v3 temporarily while investigating
- Monitor workflow execution logs for any unexpected behavior

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Upgrade Validation
1. **Syntax Check**: Validate YAML syntax and action references
2. **Version Verification**: Confirm v4 is the latest stable version
3. **Compatibility Review**: Check GitHub's migration guide for breaking changes

### Post-Upgrade Validation
1. **Workflow Execution**: Trigger test runs to verify successful artifact uploads
2. **Artifact Verification**: Confirm artifacts are created and accessible
3. **Download Testing**: Verify artifacts can be downloaded and used as expected

### Test Scenarios
- **E2E Test Failure**: Ensure artifacts are uploaded even when tests fail
- **Performance Benchmark**: Verify benchmark results are properly stored
- **Artifact Retention**: Confirm default retention policies are maintained
- **Multiple Artifacts**: Test concurrent artifact uploads don't conflict

## Implementation Approach

### Change Strategy
1. **Single Atomic Change**: Update all instances in one commit to maintain consistency
2. **Minimal Modification**: Only change version numbers, preserve all other configuration
3. **Validation First**: Verify syntax before committing changes

### Deployment Process
1. Create feature branch for the upgrade
2. Apply version updates to workflow file
3. Validate YAML syntax and action references
4. Test workflow execution with sample triggers
5. Merge to main branch after validation

### Monitoring and Verification
- Monitor first few workflow runs after deployment
- Check GitHub Actions logs for any deprecation warnings
- Verify artifact upload success rates remain consistent
- Confirm artifact accessibility for downstream consumers
