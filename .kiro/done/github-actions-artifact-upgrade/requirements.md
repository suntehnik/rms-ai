# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the deprecation of GitHub Actions `actions/upload-artifact@v3` in our CI/CD pipeline. The GitHub Actions team has deprecated v3 and recommends upgrading to v4 for improved security, performance, and new features. This upgrade ensures our workflows remain compatible with GitHub's infrastructure and benefit from the latest improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to upgrade deprecated GitHub Actions to their latest versions, so that our CI/CD pipeline remains secure and compatible with GitHub's infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use `actions/upload-artifact@v4` instead of `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
2. WHEN uploading artifacts THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing artifact consumption patterns
3. WHEN the upgrade is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work without breaking changes
4. WHEN artifacts are uploaded THEN they SHALL be accessible with the same naming conventions as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to continue uploading test results and benchmark data, so that I can access build artifacts for debugging and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN E2E tests complete THEN the system SHALL upload test results artifacts using the latest action version
2. WHEN performance benchmarks run THEN the system SHALL upload benchmark results using the latest action version
3. WHEN artifacts are uploaded THEN they SHALL include all necessary files (logs, test results, benchmark data)
4. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL still upload artifacts for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want to fix any incomplete version references in GitHub Actions, so that the workflow configuration is consistent and error-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the workflow file THEN all action versions SHALL be complete and properly specified
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN there SHALL be no syntax errors or incomplete version references
3. WHEN actions are referenced THEN they SHALL use the full semantic version format (e.g., @v4.0.0 or @v4)
4. WHEN the configuration is validated THEN all action references SHALL be syntactically correct
