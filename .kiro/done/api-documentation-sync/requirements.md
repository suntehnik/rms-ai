# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical inconsistencies between the OpenAPI specification documentation and the actual API implementation in the Product Requirements Management System. The analysis revealed significant gaps where implemented endpoints are not documented, and documented endpoints may not match the actual implementation. This creates confusion for API consumers and makes the system difficult to integrate with.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want complete and accurate API documentation, so that I can successfully integrate with all available endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review the OpenAPI specification THEN it SHALL include all implemented endpoints from the routes file
2. WHEN I check the comprehensive deletion endpoints THEN they SHALL be fully documented with request/response schemas
3. WHEN I examine entity comment endpoints THEN all comment-related endpoints SHALL be documented for each entity type
4. WHEN I look at navigation endpoints THEN all hierarchy endpoints SHALL be documented including the missing epic and user story specific endpoints


### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent response formats across all endpoints, so that I can build reliable client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call any list endpoint THEN it SHALL return a consistent ListResponse format with data, total_count, limit, and offset
2. WHEN I call configuration endpoints THEN they SHALL use the standard ListResponse format instead of custom formats
3. WHEN I receive error responses THEN they SHALL follow the standard ErrorResponse format across all endpoints
4. WHEN I call endpoints with authentication THEN the authentication requirements SHALL be clearly documented
5. WHEN I review endpoint documentation THEN response formats SHALL include detailed schemas and examples

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OpenAPI specification to accurately reflect authentication and authorization requirements, so that I can implement proper security in client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review any endpoint documentation THEN it SHALL clearly indicate if authentication is required
2. WHEN I check admin-only endpoints THEN they SHALL be marked with appropriate security requirements
3. WHEN I examine configuration endpoints THEN they SHALL indicate administrator role requirements
4. WHEN I look at public endpoints THEN they SHALL be clearly marked as not requiring authentication

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive documentation for the comment system, so that I can implement comment functionality in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review comment endpoints THEN all general comment operations SHALL be documented (get, update, delete, resolve, unresolve)
2. WHEN I check entity-specific comment endpoints THEN each entity type SHALL have documented comment endpoints
3. WHEN I examine inline comment functionality THEN the inline comment creation and validation endpoints SHALL be documented
4. WHEN I look at comment threading THEN the reply functionality SHALL be documented with proper schemas
5. WHEN I examine endpoint documentation THEN response formats SHALL be clearly documented with examples for each endpoint


### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want complete documentation for the deletion system, so that I can implement safe deletion workflows in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review deletion endpoints THEN the validate-deletion endpoints SHALL be documented for all entity types
2. WHEN I check comprehensive deletion THEN the /delete endpoints SHALL be documented with dependency information
3. WHEN I examine deletion confirmation THEN the general deletion confirmation endpoint SHALL be documented
4. WHEN I look at deletion responses THEN the dependency validation and deletion result schemas SHALL be defined

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the API, I want the implementation to match the documented specification, so that there are no surprises for API consumers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I compare routes to documentation THEN every implemented endpoint SHALL have corresponding documentation
2. WHEN I check documented endpoints THEN they SHALL have actual implementations in the routes file
3. WHEN I review endpoint parameters THEN they SHALL match between documentation and implementation
4. WHEN I examine response schemas THEN they SHALL accurately reflect the actual response structure
