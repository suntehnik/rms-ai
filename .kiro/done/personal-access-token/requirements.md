# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication in the Product Requirements Management System. The PAT system will enable secure authentication for MCP (Model Context Protocol) clients and AI agents without requiring complex OAuth 2.0 flows. This implementation will provide a secure, user-friendly way for programmatic clients to authenticate with the system while maintaining proper security practices for token generation, storage, and management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Personal Access Token Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate Personal Access Tokens through the web interface, so that I can authenticate my MCP clients and AI agents securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests PAT creation THEN the system SHALL generate a unique, cryptographically secure token using crypto/rand
2. WHEN creating PATs THEN users SHALL be able to specify a descriptive token name for identification
3. WHEN creating PATs THEN users SHALL be able to optionally set an expiration date
4. WHEN creating PATs THEN users SHALL be able to specify scope permissions (initially full access, with read-only planned for future)
5. WHEN PATs are generated THEN the system SHALL display the complete token only once to the user
6. WHEN PATs are generated THEN the system SHALL store only the bcrypt hash of the token in the database
7. IF PAT creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and guidance

### Requirement 2: Personal Access Token Authentication

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to authenticate using Personal Access Tokens, so that I can access the API securely without user credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client makes a request THEN it SHALL include the PAT in the Authorization header as "Bearer <token>"
2. WHEN the system receives a PAT THEN it SHALL extract the token from the Authorization header
3. WHEN validating a PAT THEN the system SHALL compare the token against stored bcrypt hashes
4. WHEN a valid PAT is found THEN the system SHALL identify the associated user and execute requests on their behalf
5. WHEN a PAT is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
6. WHEN a PAT is successfully used THEN the system SHALL update the last_used_at timestamp
7. IF PAT validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt for security monitoring

### Requirement 3: Personal Access Token Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my Personal Access Tokens, so that I can maintain control over my API access and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their PATs THEN the system SHALL display a list with metadata (name, creation date, expiration, last used)
2. WHEN displaying PATs THEN the system SHALL NOT show the actual token values
3. WHEN a user wants to revoke a PAT THEN they SHALL be able to delete it through the web interface
4. WHEN a PAT is revoked THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate it and prevent further use
5. WHEN PATs expire THEN the system SHALL automatically invalidate them
6. WHEN PATs are near expiration THEN the system SHALL notify users before they expire
7. IF a user has no PATs THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on creating their first token

### Requirement 4: Personal Access Token API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a developer, I want REST API endpoints for PAT management, so that I can integrate token management into applications and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing PAT endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide GET /api/v1/pats for listing user tokens
2. WHEN implementing PAT endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide POST /api/v1/pats for creating new tokens
3. WHEN implementing PAT endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide DELETE /api/v1/pats/{id} for revoking tokens
4. WHEN listing PATs THEN the API SHALL return only metadata without actual token values
5. WHEN creating PATs THEN the API SHALL return the full token only in the creation response
6. WHEN managing PATs THEN all endpoints SHALL require proper user authentication
7. IF PAT operations fail THEN the API SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 5: Personal Access Token Security

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want PAT implementation to follow security best practices, so that the system maintains high security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating tokens THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation (crypto/rand)
2. WHEN storing tokens THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt hashing with appropriate cost factor
3. WHEN tokens include prefixes THEN they SHALL use "mcp_pat_" for easy identification
4. WHEN tokens are transmitted THEN they SHALL only be sent over HTTPS connections
5. WHEN tokens are logged THEN the system SHALL never log actual token values
6. WHEN implementing rate limiting THEN the system SHALL protect PAT endpoints from abuse
7. IF security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL log events for monitoring and alerting
