# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a production initialization service that safely sets up a fresh installation of the product requirements management system. The service creates a separate binary that performs initial database setup, runs migrations, and creates a default admin user with configurable credentials. The service includes safety mechanisms to prevent execution on databases with existing data, ensuring it only runs on completely fresh installations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an operations specialist, I want a dedicated initialization binary, so that I can safely set up the system in production environments without affecting existing installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initialization binary is executed THEN the system SHALL create a separate executable distinct from the main server binary
2. WHEN the binary is built THEN the system SHALL place it in the bin/ directory with a clear name indicating its purpose
3. WHEN the binary is executed THEN the system SHALL use the same configuration system as the main application
4. IF the binary execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and exit with appropriate status codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an operations specialist, I want the initialization service to perform database setup and migrations, so that the database is properly configured for the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initialization service runs THEN the system SHALL establish a database connection using the configured connection parameters
2. WHEN database connection is established THEN the system SHALL verify the database is accessible and responsive
3. WHEN database verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL execute all pending database migrations in the correct order
4. IF any migration fails THEN the system SHALL halt execution and report the specific migration error
5. WHEN all migrations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL verify the database schema matches expected structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an operations specialist, I want to create a default admin user with configurable credentials, so that I can access the system immediately after initialization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initialization service runs THEN the system SHALL create a user with username "admin"
2. WHEN creating the admin user THEN the system SHALL use a password from environment variable ADMIN_PASSWORD
3. IF ADMIN_PASSWORD is not set THEN the system SHALL generate a secure random password and display it clearly
4. WHEN the admin user is created THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate administrative privileges
5. WHEN user creation completes THEN the system SHALL log the successful creation with the username (but not the password)
6. IF user creation fails THEN the system SHALL report the specific error and halt execution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an operations specialist, I want the initialization service to only run on fresh installations, so that I cannot accidentally corrupt existing production data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initialization service starts THEN the system SHALL check if any user records exist in the database
2. WHEN the initialization service starts THEN the system SHALL check if any epic records exist in the database
3. WHEN the initialization service starts THEN the system SHALL check if any user story records exist in the database
4. IF any existing data is found THEN the system SHALL immediately exit with an error message indicating the database is not empty
5. WHEN data existence checks pass THEN the system SHALL proceed with initialization
6. WHEN data existence checks fail THEN the system SHALL log the specific tables that contain data
7. IF the database connection fails during safety checks THEN the system SHALL report the connection error and exit

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an operations specialist, I want comprehensive logging and status reporting during initialization, so that I can monitor the process and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initialization service starts THEN the system SHALL log the start of the initialization process
2. WHEN each major step begins THEN the system SHALL log the step name and current status
3. WHEN each major step completes THEN the system SHALL log successful completion with timing information
4. IF any step fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including context
5. WHEN initialization completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log a summary of all completed actions
6. WHEN initialization completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display next steps for the operator
7. WHEN logging occurs THEN the system SHALL use structured logging consistent with the main application

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an operations specialist, I want the initialization service to validate the environment before proceeding, so that I can identify configuration issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initialization service starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
2. WHEN environment validation occurs THEN the system SHALL check database connection parameters are valid
3. WHEN environment validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify JWT_SECRET is configured
4. IF any required configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL list all missing items and exit
5. WHEN configuration validation passes THEN the system SHALL log successful validation
6. WHEN database connectivity is tested THEN the system SHALL verify the database server is reachable and responsive
