# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration in the Product Requirements Management System. The MCP server will enable AI agents (such as Claude Desktop) to interact with the system through a standardized protocol, providing contextual information, executable tools, and AI-assisted workflows. This implementation consists of two components: a standalone MCP Server (console Go application) that communicates via STDIO with AI hosts, and a Backend API Handler that processes MCP requests. The system will use existing PAT authentication infrastructure for secure access.

## Requirements
