# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The system currently has infrastructure for running performance benchmarks (Makefile targets, GitHub Actions workflows) but lacks actual benchmark test implementations. This feature will implement comprehensive benchmark tests for critical system components to measure and track performance over time, ensuring the system maintains acceptable performance as it evolves.

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-1: Performance Tests Must Use Production-Like Environment
**Decision:** All performance benchmark tests shall run against actual service API endpoints using PostgreSQL database, not against isolated database operations or in-memory SQLite.

**Rationale:** 
- Performance characteristics differ significantly between SQLite and PostgreSQL
- API endpoint testing captures the full request/response cycle including middleware overhead
- Database-only tests miss critical performance factors like JSON serialization, HTTP handling, and authentication
- Production environment uses PostgreSQL, so benchmarks must reflect real-world performance

**Implications:**
- Benchmark tests will use testcontainers to spin up PostgreSQL instances
- Tests will make HTTP requests to actual server endpoints
- Performance measurements will include full stack latency, not just database query time

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want benchmark tests for core services, so that I can measure and track performance characteristics of critical system components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmark tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics for search operations
2. WHEN benchmark tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics for API endpoint CRUD operations on all major entities (Epic, UserStory, Requirement, AcceptanceCriteria)
3. WHEN benchmark tests are executed THEN the system SHALL measure memory allocation patterns and garbage collection impact
4. WHEN benchmark tests are executed THEN the system SHALL complete without errors using the existing `make test-bench` command
5. WHEN benchmark tests are executed THEN the system SHALL output results in Go benchmark format for tooling compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want benchmark tests for database operations, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks in data access patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure API endpoint performance for all CRUD operations via HTTP requests
2. WHEN database benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL test PostgreSQL performance characteristics using testcontainers
3. WHEN database benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure query execution times for complex operations including joins and full-text search
4. WHEN database benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for bulk operations (batch inserts, updates, deletes)
5. WHEN database benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure connection pool performance under load

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want benchmark tests integrated with CI/CD, so that performance regressions can be detected automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmark tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL generate benchmark result files in standard Go benchmark format
2. WHEN benchmark tests complete THEN the system SHALL upload results as GitHub Actions artifacts
3. WHEN benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL not fail the build for performance variations within acceptable thresholds
4. WHEN benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL provide consistent and repeatable results across different environments
5. WHEN benchmark tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (under 10 minutes)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want benchmark tests for search functionality, so that I can optimize search performance for large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure full-text search API endpoint performance across all searchable entities
2. WHEN search benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL test search performance with varying dataset sizes (100, 1000, 10000 records)
3. WHEN search benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure search result ranking and relevance scoring performance
4. WHEN search benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL test concurrent search operations to measure scalability
5. WHEN search benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure PostgreSQL full-text search index performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want benchmark tests for service layer operations, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks in business logic processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure API endpoint performance of all service layer operations
2. WHEN service benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL test relationship management operations performance
3. WHEN service benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure comment system performance including threading operations
4. WHEN service benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL test status transition operations performance
5. WHEN service benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure validation and business rule processing performance
