# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The system currently has infrastructure for running performance benchmarks (Makefile targets, GitHub Actions workflows) but lacks actual benchmark test implementations. This feature will implement comprehensive benchmark tests for critical system components to measure and track performance over time, ensuring the system maintains acceptable performance as it evolves.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want benchmark tests for core services, so that I can measure and track performance characteristics of critical system components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmark tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics for search operations
2. WHEN benchmark tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics for CRUD operations on all major entities
3. WHEN benchmark tests are executed THEN the system SHALL measure memory allocation patterns
4. WHEN benchmark tests are executed THEN the system SHALL complete without errors using the existing `make test-bench` command

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want benchmark tests for database operations, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks in data access patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure repository operation performance
2. WHEN database benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL test both SQLite and PostgreSQL performance characteristics
3. WHEN database benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure query execution times for complex operations
4. WHEN database benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for bulk operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want benchmark tests integrated with CI/CD, so that performance regressions can be detected automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmark tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL generate benchmark result files
2. WHEN benchmark tests complete THEN the system SHALL upload results as artifacts
3. WHEN benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL not fail the build for performance variations
4. WHEN benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL provide consistent and repeatable results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want benchmark tests for search functionality, so that I can optimize search performance for large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure full-text search performance
2. WHEN search benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL test search performance with varying dataset sizes
3. WHEN search benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL measure search result ranking performance
4. WHEN search benchmark tests run THEN the system SHALL test concurrent search operations
