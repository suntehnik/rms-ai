# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This epic focuses on implementing the `resources/list` method in the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. The resources primitive in MCP provides structured access to information that AI applications can retrieve and use as context. This implementation will enable the MCP server to expose available resources to connected clients, allowing them to discover what contextual information is available from the requirements management system.

The `resources/list` method is a core MCP primitive that returns metadata about available resources without their actual content. This allows clients to understand what information sources are available before requesting specific resource data through `resources/read`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** [US-980: Implement Basic Resources List Method Handler](https://requirements-system/user-stories/US-980) - As an MCP client application, I want to call the `resources/list` method so that I can discover what resources are available from the requirements management server.

3. WHEN listing resources THEN the system SHALL include filtered list resources with appropriate URI templates
4. WHEN listing resources THEN search and filter resources SHALL be properly documented with parameter descriptions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** [US-983: Ensure MCP Protocol Compliance](https://requirements-system/user-stories/US-983) - As a developer integrating with the MCP server, I want the `resources/list` implementation to follow MCP protocol specifications so that it works correctly with standard MCP clients.

**Related Requirements:**
- [REQ-5426: JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification Compliance](https://requirements-system/requirements/REQ-5426)

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN implementing the method THEN the system SHALL use the exact method name `resources/list`
3. WHEN implementing the method THEN the response SHALL match the MCP specification schema for resources/list
4. WHEN implementing the method THEN the system SHALL handle the method without requiring parameters
5. WHEN implementing the method THEN the system SHALL return resources in a consistent, predictable order

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** [US-984: Implement Error Handling and Logging](https://requirements-system/user-stories/US-984) - As a system administrator, I want the `resources/list` method to handle errors gracefully so that the MCP server remains stable and provides useful error information.
