# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for MCP (Model Context Protocol) client functionality to create acceptance criteria for user stories. The system shall provide MCP tools that allow AI agents and other MCP clients to programmatically create acceptance criteria with proper validation, linking to user stories, and comprehensive field management.

## Glossary

- **MCP_Client**: A client application that communicates with the system using the Model Context Protocol
- **Acceptance_Criteria_System**: The backend system responsible for managing acceptance criteria entities and their relationships
- **User_Story_System**: The system component that manages user stories and their relationships to acceptance criteria
- **Validation_System**: The component responsible for validating input data and business rules
- **Reference_Resolution_System**: The system that resolves both UUID and human-readable reference IDs (like US-045)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to create acceptance criteria for user stories using either UUID or reference ID, so that I can programmatically manage acceptance criteria without needing to know internal UUID formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client provides a user story UUID, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL create the acceptance criteria linked to that user story
2. WHEN an MCP client provides a user story reference ID (format US-XXX), THE Reference_Resolution_System SHALL resolve it to the corresponding UUID and link the acceptance criteria
3. IF the provided user story identifier does not exist, THEN THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return a JSON-RPC error with code -32602 (Invalid params) and message "User story not found"
4. WHEN the user story identifier is valid, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL establish the parent-child relationship between user story and acceptance criteria
5. THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL validate that the user story identifier is not empty or null before processing

_Requirements: REQ-036_

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to specify a description for acceptance criteria, so that I can define clear, testable conditions for user story completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client provides a description field, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL store the description with the acceptance criteria
2. THE Validation_System SHALL require that the description field is not empty or null
3. THE Validation_System SHALL limit the description field to a maximum of 50000 characters
4. WHEN the description exceeds the character limit, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return a JSON-RPC error with code -32602 (Invalid params) and message "Description exceeds maximum length of 50000 characters"
5. THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL preserve the exact formatting and content of the provided description

_Requirements: REQ-037_

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want automatic metadata management for acceptance criteria, so that I can track creation details without manually managing system fields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client creates acceptance criteria, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL automatically set the creation timestamp
2. WHEN an MCP client creates acceptance criteria, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL automatically set the author_id from the authenticated MCP client context
3. WHEN an MCP client creates acceptance criteria, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL automatically generate a unique reference_id in format AC-XXX
4. THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL automatically set the updated_at timestamp to match created_at during initial creation
5. THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return the complete acceptance criteria object including all auto-generated fields

_Requirements: US-045_

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want comprehensive error handling and validation feedback, so that I can understand and correct any issues with my acceptance criteria creation requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails for any field, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return a JSON-RPC error response with code -32602 (Invalid params) and field-specific messages
2. WHEN the user story reference cannot be resolved, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return a JSON-RPC error with code -32602 (Invalid params) and the invalid identifier included in the message
3. WHEN authentication fails, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return a JSON-RPC error with code -32001 (Server error - Unauthorized) and message "Authentication required"
4. WHEN the MCP client lacks permissions, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return a JSON-RPC error with code -32001 (Server error - Forbidden) and message "Insufficient permissions to create acceptance criteria"
5. WHEN successful, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return the created acceptance criteria in the JSON-RPC result field with all populated fields

_Requirements: US-045, REQ-036, REQ-037_

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want consistent API response format, so that I can reliably parse and handle responses from the acceptance criteria creation endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN acceptance criteria creation succeeds, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return the complete acceptance criteria object in the JSON-RPC result field with all fields populated
2. THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL include the resolved user_story relationship in the response when requested with include parameter
3. WHEN errors occur, THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return a consistent JSON-RPC error structure with appropriate error codes and descriptive messages
4. THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL use standard JSON-RPC error codes (-32700 Parse error, -32600 Invalid Request, -32601 Method not found, -32602 Invalid params, -32603 Internal error, -32001 to -32099 Server error range)
5. THE Acceptance_Criteria_System SHALL return responses in JSON-RPC 2.0 format with proper content-type application/json headers
