# Implementation Plan

Convert the feature design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step with incremental progress. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. Focus ONLY on tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code.

## Task List

- [x] 1. Create MCP tool structure and JSON schema definition
  - Implement `AcceptanceCriteriaTool` struct following existing MCP tool patterns
  - Define JSON schema for tool parameters (user_story_id, description)
  - Implement tool discovery method that returns tool definition
  - _Requirements: REQ-036, REQ-037_

- [ ] 2. Implement core MCP tool execution logic
  - [ ] 2.1 Implement JSON-RPC request parsing and validation
    - Parse MCP tool call parameters from JSON-RPC request
    - Validate required fields (user_story_id, description)
    - Implement field-level validation (description max 50000 chars)
    - _Requirements: REQ-036, REQ-037_

  - [ ] 2.2 Implement user story identifier resolution
    - Add method to resolve user story by UUID or reference ID (US-XXX)
    - Handle both UUID format and reference ID format validation
    - Return appropriate JSON-RPC errors for invalid identifiers
    - _Requirements: REQ-036_

  - [ ] 2.3 Implement acceptance criteria creation logic
    - Extract authenticated user ID from Gin context using existing auth patterns
    - Create acceptance criteria using existing service layer
    - Handle service layer errors and map to JSON-RPC error codes
    - _Requirements: REQ-036, REQ-037_

- [ ] 3. Implement JSON-RPC response formatting
  - [ ] 3.1 Create structured response objects
    - Implement response structure with all acceptance criteria fields
    - Format timestamps and UUIDs for JSON serialization
    - Include auto-generated reference ID in response
    - _Requirements: REQ-036, REQ-037_

  - [ ] 3.2 Implement comprehensive error handling
    - Map service errors to appropriate JSON-RPC error codes
    - Create detailed error messages for validation failures
    - Handle authentication and authorization errors
    - _Requirements: REQ-036, REQ-037_

- [ ] 4. Integrate MCP tool with existing MCP handler
  - [ ] 4.1 Register acceptance criteria tool with MCP handler
    - Add tool to existing MCP handler's tool registry
    - Ensure tool is discoverable via tools/list method
    - Verify tool execution via tools/call method
    - _Requirements: REQ-036, REQ-037_

  - [ ] 4.2 Update MCP capabilities and tool provider
    - Ensure acceptance criteria tool is included in server capabilities
    - Update tool provider to include new tool
    - Verify integration with existing MCP infrastructure
    - _Requirements: REQ-036, REQ-037_

- [ ] 5. Write comprehensive tests for MCP tool
  - [ ] 5.1 Write unit tests for tool validation logic
    - Test user story identifier validation (UUID and reference ID formats)
    - Test description field validation (required, max length)
    - Test error handling for invalid inputs
    - _Requirements: REQ-036, REQ-037_

  - [ ]* 5.2 Write integration tests for MCP tool execution
    - Test complete JSON-RPC request/response cycle
    - Test authentication integration with existing middleware
    - Test database persistence through service layer
    - _Requirements: REQ-036, REQ-037_

  - [ ] 5.3 Write MCP protocol compliance tests
    - Test tool discovery via tools/list endpoint
    - Test tool execution via tools/call endpoint
    - Test JSON-RPC 2.0 format compliance
    - _Requirements: REQ-036, REQ-037_
