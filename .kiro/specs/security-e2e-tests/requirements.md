# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive end-to-end security tests that validate the authentication and authorization system of the Product Requirements Management API. The tests will verify the permission matrix, role-based access control (RBAC), JWT token handling, and security error responses to ensure the system properly protects against unauthorized access and maintains proper security boundaries.

**Critical Security Gap Identified**: The current implementation has a major security vulnerability where most API endpoints (epics, user stories, requirements, acceptance criteria, comments, search, navigation, config) do not have any authentication middleware applied. Only the `/auth/*` routes have proper authentication and authorization middleware. This means the API is currently open to unauthorized access for most operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive e2e tests for authentication flows, so that I can verify JWT token generation, validation, and expiration handling work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a valid JWT token with correct claims
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with generic authentication failure message
3. WHEN a user uses an expired token THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with generic authentication failure message
4. WHEN a user uses a malformed token THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with generic authentication failure message
5. WHEN a user accesses protected endpoints without authentication THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with generic authentication required message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want e2e tests for the permission matrix, so that I can verify each role has exactly the permissions specified in the security guide.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Administrator accesses any endpoint THEN the system SHALL allow access to all operations
2. WHEN a User accesses entity CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL allow create, read, update, delete for epics, user stories, requirements, and acceptance criteria
3. WHEN a User accesses user management endpoints THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 403 with generic insufficient permissions message
4. WHEN a Commenter accesses entity creation endpoints THEN the system SHALL currently allow access due to missing authentication middleware (security gap)
5. WHEN a Commenter accesses view-only endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow read access to all entities
6. WHEN any role accesses comment operations THEN the system SHALL enforce comment-specific permissions per the matrix

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want e2e tests for unauthorized access attempts, so that I can verify the system properly blocks malicious or accidental security violations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an attacker attempts SQL injection in authentication THEN the system SHALL sanitize inputs and return appropriate error without exposing database information
2. WHEN an attacker uses a token with tampered signature THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with generic authentication failure message
3. WHEN an attacker attempts privilege escalation by modifying JWT claims THEN the system SHALL reject the token and return HTTP 401 with generic authentication failure message
4. WHEN an attacker attempts to access admin endpoints with lower privileges THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 403 with generic insufficient permissions message
5. WHEN an attacker attempts brute force login THEN the system SHALL handle multiple failed attempts gracefully without system degradation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want e2e tests for role-specific endpoint access, so that I can verify each endpoint enforces the correct minimum role requirement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing public endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow access without authentication for health checks and login
2. WHEN testing commenter-level endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow access for Commenter, User, and Administrator roles
3. WHEN testing user-level endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow access for User and Administrator roles only
4. WHEN testing administrator-level endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow access for Administrator role only
5. WHEN testing with insufficient role permissions THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 403 with generic insufficient permissions message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want e2e tests for comment system security, so that I can verify users can only edit their own comments and resolve permissions work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a comment THEN the system SHALL associate the comment with the authenticated user
2. WHEN a user attempts to edit their own comment THEN the system SHALL allow the operation
3. WHEN a user attempts to edit another user's comment AND has User or Administrator role THEN the system SHALL allow the operation
4. WHEN a Commenter attempts to edit another user's comment THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 403
5. WHEN any authenticated user attempts to resolve comments THEN the system SHALL allow the operation per the permission matrix

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want e2e tests for security error handling, so that I can verify the system returns appropriate error codes and messages without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return generic error messages without exposing internal system details or specific failure reasons
3. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL return generic authentication failure messages without revealing whether token is expired, malformed, or invalid
4. WHEN system errors occur during security operations THEN the system SHALL log security events without exposing sensitive data in responses
5. WHEN invalid input is provided to security endpoints THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all inputs before processing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want e2e tests that simulate real-world attack scenarios, so that I can verify the system's resilience against common security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simulating session hijacking attempts THEN the system SHALL validate token integrity and reject tampered tokens
2. WHEN simulating cross-site request forgery THEN the system SHALL enforce proper CORS policies and token validation
3. WHEN simulating privilege escalation attempts THEN the system SHALL maintain role boundaries and audit security violations
4. WHEN simulating data exfiltration attempts THEN the system SHALL enforce proper authorization on all data access endpoints
5. WHEN simulating denial of service through authentication THEN the system SHALL handle high volumes of authentication requests gracefully

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want e2e tests that validate the current security gaps, so that I can document and verify which endpoints are currently unprotected and need authentication middleware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API v1 endpoints without authentication THEN the system SHALL currently allow unauthorized access (documenting the security gap)
2. WHEN testing entity CRUD operations without authentication THEN the system SHALL currently allow unauthorized access to epics, user stories, requirements, and acceptance criteria
3. WHEN testing search endpoints without authentication THEN the system SHALL currently allow unauthorized access to search functionality
4. WHEN testing comment endpoints without authentication THEN the system SHALL currently allow unauthorized access to comment operations
5. WHEN testing configuration endpoints without authentication THEN the system SHALL currently allow unauthorized access to system configuration (critical security risk)
