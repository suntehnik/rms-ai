# Requirements Document: Mock Service Interface Fix

## Introduction

The MockCommentService in the comment handler tests is missing the GetCommentReplies method, causing a compilation error where the mock doesn't implement the CommentService interface. This prevents the test suite from compiling and running successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MockCommentService to implement all required interface methods, so that the test suite compiles and runs successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MockCommentService is used in tests THEN it SHALL implement all methods defined in the CommentService interface
2. WHEN the test suite is compiled THEN it SHALL not produce interface implementation errors
3. WHEN the GetCommentReplies method is called on MockCommentService THEN it SHALL return the expected mock response
4. WHEN the test suite runs THEN all existing comment handler tests SHALL continue to pass
