# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an embedded MCP (Model Context Protocol) server within the existing Product Requirements Management System. The MCP server will provide AI-powered assistance for all user roles while maintaining security, performance, and integration with the existing REST API architecture.

The embedded MCP server will enable AI agents to perform critical business functions on behalf of authenticated users, providing intelligent automation and support for product management workflows.
