# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the Product Requirements Management API. The system currently has a well-structured REST API with multiple endpoints for managing epics, user stories, acceptance criteria, requirements, comments, search, and configuration. The goal is to provide complete API documentation that enables developers to understand, test, and integrate with the API effectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive Swagger documentation, so that I can understand all available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification
2. WHEN viewing the documentation THEN the system SHALL display all REST endpoints with their HTTP methods, paths, and descriptions
3. WHEN examining endpoint details THEN the system SHALL show request/response schemas, parameters, and status codes
4. WHEN reviewing the API THEN the system SHALL document authentication and authorization requirements
5. WHEN accessing the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide interactive testing capabilities through Swagger UI

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed request and response schemas, so that I can properly structure API calls and handle responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing endpoint documentation THEN the system SHALL display complete request body schemas with field types, constraints, and examples
2. WHEN examining responses THEN the system SHALL show response schemas for all HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, etc.)
3. WHEN reviewing data models THEN the system SHALL document all entity schemas (Epic, UserStory, Requirement, AcceptanceCriteria, Comment, etc.)
4. WHEN looking at parameters THEN the system SHALL specify path parameters, query parameters, and headers with their types and constraints
5. WHEN examining schemas THEN the system SHALL include validation rules, required fields, and field descriptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want interactive API testing capabilities, so that I can test endpoints directly from the documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Swagger UI THEN the system SHALL provide "Try it out" functionality for all endpoints
2. WHEN testing endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow input of parameters, request bodies, and headers
3. WHEN executing requests THEN the system SHALL display actual HTTP responses with status codes and response bodies
4. WHEN testing authenticated endpoints THEN the system SHALL support authentication token input
5. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide example requests and responses for common use cases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a technical writer, I want well-organized API documentation, so that I can create comprehensive integration guides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the documentation THEN the system SHALL organize endpoints by logical groups (Epics, User Stories, Requirements, Comments, Search, Config)
2. WHEN examining endpoint groups THEN the system SHALL provide clear descriptions and use cases for each group
3. WHEN reviewing the API THEN the system SHALL document common patterns like pagination, filtering, and sorting
4. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL include error handling patterns and common error responses
5. WHEN viewing the specification THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive examples for complex operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Swagger documentation to be automatically generated and kept up-to-date, so that documentation remains accurate as the API evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically update the OpenAPI specification
2. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL serve the latest API documentation at a standard endpoint
3. WHEN endpoints are added or modified THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in the documentation without manual intervention
4. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL include Swagger UI as part of the deployment
5. WHEN accessing the documentation THEN the system SHALL display the current API version and build information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an integration developer, I want detailed documentation of the hierarchical data relationships, so that I can understand how entities relate to each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing entity documentation THEN the system SHALL show relationships between Epics, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Requirements
2. WHEN examining endpoints THEN the system SHALL document nested resource patterns (e.g., /epics/:id/user-stories)
3. WHEN reviewing data models THEN the system SHALL show foreign key relationships and reference ID patterns
4. WHEN looking at responses THEN the system SHALL document when related entities are included or excluded
5. WHEN examining the API THEN the system SHALL provide examples of hierarchical data retrieval patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want comprehensive search and filtering documentation, so that I can implement efficient data retrieval in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing search endpoints THEN the system SHALL document all available search parameters and their usage
2. WHEN examining filtering options THEN the system SHALL show all supported filter parameters for each entity type
3. WHEN reviewing pagination THEN the system SHALL document limit, offset, and response metadata patterns
4. WHEN looking at sorting THEN the system SHALL show all available sort fields and sort orders
5. WHEN examining search responses THEN the system SHALL document the search result structure and metadata

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want clear documentation of authentication and authorization patterns, so that I can assess API security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing security THEN the system SHALL document authentication methods (JWT tokens, API keys, etc.)
2. WHEN examining endpoints THEN the system SHALL indicate which endpoints require authentication
3. WHEN viewing authorization THEN the system SHALL document role-based access control if implemented
4. WHEN looking at security headers THEN the system SHALL document required security headers and their formats
5. WHEN examining error responses THEN the system SHALL document authentication and authorization error patterns
