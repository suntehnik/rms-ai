# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The system is designed for centralized management of the product requirements lifecycle, including creation, editing, approval, status tracking, and relationships between requirements. The system should ensure effective work of product teams with hierarchical requirement structure: epics → user stories → requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Epic Management

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to manage epics, so that I can structure large functional blocks of the product

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new epic THEN the system SHALL save the epic with fields: creator, assignee (default = creator), creation date, last modification date, priority, status, brief title, detailed description in Markdown format
2. WHEN a user edits an epic THEN the system SHALL update the last modification date and save changes
3. WHEN a user deletes an epic THEN the system SHALL request confirmation and verify absence of related user stories
4. WHEN a user assigns responsibility for an epic THEN the system SHALL allow changing the assignee to any system user
5. WHEN a user sets epic priority THEN the system SHALL use values: Critical (1), High (2), Medium (3), Low (4)
6. WHEN a user changes epic status THEN the system SHALL support statuses: Backlog, Draft, In Progress, Done, Cancelled with ability for any transitions

### Requirement 2: User Story Management

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to create and manage user stories, so that I can detail functionality within epics

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a user story THEN the system SHALL save it with the same fields as epic and mandatory link to an epic
2. WHEN a user creates a user story THEN the system SHALL use the classic template "As [role], I want [function], so that [goal]" in description
3. WHEN a user edits a user story THEN the system SHALL update the last modification date
4. WHEN a user deletes a user story THEN the system SHALL verify absence of related requirements
5. WHEN a user changes user story status THEN the system SHALL support statuses: Backlog, Draft, In Progress, Done, Cancelled

### Requirement 3: Acceptance Criteria Management

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want to create acceptance criteria for user stories, so that I can clearly define readiness conditions for functionality

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates acceptance criteria THEN the system SHALL save it with fields: identifier, creation date, modification date, author, description
2. WHEN a user creates acceptance criteria THEN the system SHALL link it to one user story
3. WHEN any system user creates/edits acceptance criteria THEN the system SHALL allow this operation
4. WHEN a user story is created THEN the system SHALL require at least one acceptance criteria

### Requirement 4: Requirements Management

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want to create detailed requirements, so that I can precisely describe functionality for developers

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a requirement THEN the system SHALL save it with basic epic fields plus mandatory link to user story and optional link to acceptance criteria
2. WHEN a user creates a requirement THEN the system SHALL allow selecting requirement type from configurable list
3. WHEN a user deletes a requirement THEN the system SHALL request deletion confirmation
4. WHEN a user changes requirement status THEN the system SHALL support statuses: Draft, Active, Obsolete
5. WHEN a user links requirements to each other THEN the system SHALL support configurable relationship types

### Requirement 5: Commenting System

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to comment on epics, stories and requirements, so that I can discuss details and ask questions

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a general comment on an object THEN the system SHALL save the comment with fields: author, creation date, status (resolved/unresolved)
2. WHEN a user creates an inline comment THEN the system SHALL link it to selected text fragment in "description" field and save the linked text
3. WHEN a user replies to a comment THEN the system SHALL create a comment chain without depth limitation
4. WHEN any user marks a comment as "resolved" THEN the system SHALL change its status and display it in gray color
5. WHEN text linked to an inline comment is changed or deleted THEN the system SHALL hide this comment
6. WHEN a user views comments THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by status (all/resolved/unresolved)

### Requirement 6: Status Model

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage status models, so that I can configure object lifecycle according to team processes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create status models for epics, user stories and requirements with predefined statuses
2. WHEN a status model is applied THEN the system SHALL by default allow all transitions between statuses
3. WHEN a user changes object status THEN the system SHALL verify transition possibility according to status model

### Requirement 7: Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to quickly find needed objects, so that I can work efficiently with large volume of requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs full-text search THEN the system SHALL search in "brief title" and "detailed description" fields
2. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by all property fields of each entity
3. WHEN a user sorts results THEN the system SHALL support sorting by priority, creation date and modification date

### Requirement 8: Display and Navigation

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to conveniently view requirements hierarchy, so that I can understand product structure

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the main page THEN the system SHALL display hierarchical list: epics → user stories → requirements
2. WHEN a user activates an object in the list THEN the system SHALL expand detailed view of this entity
3. WHEN a user sorts the list THEN the system SHALL support sorting by priority, creation date and modification date

### Requirement 9: User and Role Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage users and their access rights, so that I can control system security

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a user THEN the system SHALL assign one of the roles: Administrator, User, Commenter
2. WHEN a user with "Administrator" role works in the system THEN the system SHALL provide full rights to all operations including user management
3. WHEN a user with "User" role works in the system THEN the system SHALL allow creation, editing and deletion of all entities
4. WHEN a user with "Commenter" role works in the system THEN the system SHALL allow only viewing all entities and creating comments

### Requirement 10: Configurable Dictionaries

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure requirement types and relationships, so that I can adapt the system to project specifics

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator configures requirement types THEN the system SHALL allow creating, editing and deleting types from the dictionary
2. WHEN an administrator configures relationship types between requirements THEN the system SHALL allow creating, editing and deleting relationship types from the dictionary
3. WHEN a user creates a requirement or relationship THEN the system SHALL provide selection from current dictionary values
