# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the benchmark test infrastructure in the product requirements management system. The current benchmark tests are functional but have several performance and reliability issues that need to be addressed to ensure consistent, efficient, and maintainable benchmark execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Container Resource Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer running benchmarks, I want the benchmark infrastructure to efficiently manage Docker containers, so that benchmark execution is faster and uses fewer system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running multiple benchmark tests THEN the system SHALL reuse containers across test functions within the same benchmark suite
2. WHEN a benchmark test completes THEN the system SHALL properly clean up containers without resource leaks
3. WHEN running benchmarks concurrently THEN the system SHALL limit the number of simultaneous containers to prevent resource exhaustion
4. IF container startup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN benchmarks are interrupted THEN the system SHALL ensure all containers are properly terminated

### Requirement 2: Server Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a developer running benchmarks, I want the HTTP server lifecycle to be optimized, so that benchmark setup and teardown is faster and more reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a benchmark server THEN the system SHALL use dynamic port allocation to avoid port conflicts
2. WHEN multiple benchmarks run in parallel THEN each SHALL use a unique port without conflicts
3. WHEN server startup fails THEN the system SHALL retry with different ports automatically
4. WHEN server shutdown occurs THEN the system SHALL complete gracefully within 5 seconds
5. IF server shutdown times out THEN the system SHALL force close connections and log the issue

### Requirement 3: Database Connection Pool Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer running benchmarks, I want database connections to be efficiently managed, so that benchmarks run faster and don't exhaust connection limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL configure optimal connection pool settings for test workloads
2. WHEN benchmark tests complete THEN all database connections SHALL be properly closed
3. WHEN running concurrent benchmarks THEN connection pools SHALL not exceed database limits
4. IF connection pool exhaustion occurs THEN the system SHALL queue requests with appropriate timeouts
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times

### Requirement 4: Test Data Management Efficiency

**User Story:** As a developer running benchmarks, I want test data generation and cleanup to be optimized, so that benchmark preparation is faster and more reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN seeding test data THEN the system SHALL use batch operations for improved performance
2. WHEN cleaning up test data THEN the system SHALL use truncate operations instead of individual deletes
3. WHEN running multiple benchmarks THEN the system SHALL cache and reuse compatible datasets
4. IF data seeding fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and cleanup partial data
5. WHEN benchmark suites complete THEN all test data SHALL be completely removed

### Requirement 5: Concurrent Execution Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer running benchmarks, I want concurrent benchmark execution to be optimized, so that parallel tests don't interfere with each other and complete efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running concurrent benchmarks THEN each SHALL use isolated database schemas or containers
2. WHEN parallel HTTP requests are made THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and keep-alives
3. WHEN concurrent tests access shared resources THEN the system SHALL implement proper synchronization
4. IF resource contention occurs THEN the system SHALL implement backoff and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN concurrent benchmarks complete THEN resource cleanup SHALL not interfere between tests

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer running benchmarks, I want comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms, so that transient failures don't cause benchmark runs to fail unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
2. WHEN container operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error context and cleanup state
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL regenerate tokens and retry the operation
4. IF benchmark infrastructure fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information
5. WHEN retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages

### Requirement 7: Performance Monitoring and Metrics

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing benchmark results, I want comprehensive performance metrics and monitoring, so that I can identify bottlenecks and track performance trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmarks run THEN the system SHALL collect detailed timing metrics for each operation
2. WHEN resource usage is high THEN the system SHALL report memory, CPU, and connection statistics
3. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN the system SHALL generate performance reports with trend analysis
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL highlight significant changes from baseline
5. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL provide percentile distributions and outlier detection

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a developer configuring benchmarks, I want flexible configuration options, so that I can customize benchmark behavior for different environments and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring benchmarks THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific settings
2. WHEN running in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL use optimized settings for automated environments
3. WHEN debugging benchmarks THEN the system SHALL support verbose logging and detailed output
4. IF custom scenarios are needed THEN the system SHALL support configurable test parameters
5. WHEN scaling tests THEN the system SHALL support adjustable concurrency and dataset sizes
