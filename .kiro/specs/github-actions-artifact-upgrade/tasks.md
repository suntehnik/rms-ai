# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Validate current workflow and identify upgrade targets
  - Read the current `.github/workflows/test-strategy.yml` file to confirm deprecated action usage
  - Document all instances of `actions/upload-artifact@v3` and incomplete version references
  - Verify the workflow syntax is valid before making changes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Update E2E test artifact upload action
  - Fix the incomplete version reference `actions/upload-artifact@v` to `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
  - Ensure the artifact upload configuration remains unchanged (name, path, if condition)
  - Validate the YAML syntax after the change
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Update performance test artifact upload action
  - Replace `actions/upload-artifact@v3` with `actions/upload-artifact@v4` in the performance-tests job
  - Preserve all existing configuration parameters (name, path)
  - Maintain the same artifact naming convention for benchmark results
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Validate workflow syntax and configuration
  - Check the updated workflow file for YAML syntax errors
  - Verify all action version references are complete and properly formatted
  - Ensure no other deprecated actions are present in the workflow
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.2, 3.4_

- [-] 5. Test workflow execution with updated actions
  - Create a test commit to trigger the workflow and verify it runs successfully
  - Monitor the workflow execution logs for any errors or warnings
  - Confirm that artifacts are uploaded successfully in both E2E and performance test jobs
  - Verify artifacts are accessible and downloadable after upload
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
