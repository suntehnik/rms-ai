  - _Requirements: 1.3_

- [x] 1.4 Add comprehensive unit tests for safety check enhancements
  - Write tests for `isTableNotFoundError()` with various PostgreSQL error types
  - Write tests for `countTableRecords()` with missing tables and database errors

  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

  - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [x] 2.2 Update initialization service to use centralized connection management

- [x] 4. Conduct Code Audit for Database Connection Anti-patterns
  - Search codebase for database connection lifecycle issues
  - Fix any components that create connections without proper cleanup
  - Fix any components that inappropriately close external connections
  - _Requirements: 2.5_

- [x] 4.1 Audit test files for connection management issues
  - Review all test files for proper database connection handling
  - Fix any test files that create connections without cleanup
  - Ensure test database connections follow proper lifecycle patterns
  - _Requirements: 2.5_

- [x] 4.2 Audit benchmark files for connection management issues
  - Review benchmark files in `internal/benchmarks/` for connection handling
  - Fix any benchmark files that create connections without cleanup
  - Ensure benchmark database connections are properly managed
  - _Requirements: 2.5_

- [ ] 5. Add Comprehensive Integration Tests
  - Create integration tests for complete initialization flow with centralized connection management
  - Test safety check functionality against various database states
  - Verify no connection leaks during normal and error scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 5.1 Create integration tests for empty database initialization
  - Test initialization against truly empty PostgreSQL database (no schema)
  - Test initialization against database with schema but no data
  - Verify safety check passes and migrations execute successfully
  - _Requirements: 1.3_

- [ ] 5.2 Create integration tests for populated database safety checks
  - Test safety check against database with partial data
  - Test safety check against database with full data
  - Verify safety check fails appropriately and provides detailed error reports
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 5.3 Create integration tests for connection lifecycle management
