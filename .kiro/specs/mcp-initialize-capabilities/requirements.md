# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of the MCP (Model Context Protocol) initialize method for the spexus requirements management system. The initialize method is the entry point for MCP clients to discover server capabilities, protocol version, and available tools, resources, and prompts.

**Related Requirements:** REQ-027, REQ-028, REQ-029, REQ-030, REQ-031, REQ-032, REQ-033, REQ-034, REQ-035

## Glossary

- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol - a standardized protocol for AI model context exchange
- **spexus**: Requirements management system that provides MCP server functionality
- **initialize method**: The initial handshake method in MCP protocol that establishes connection and capabilities
- **capabilities object**: Structure containing server's supported features (tools, resources, prompts)
- **serverInfo**: Metadata about the MCP server including name, title, and version
- **protocolVersion**: Version identifier of the MCP protocol being used
- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: Remote procedure call protocol used as transport layer for MCP

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client of the MCP protocol, I want to get a complete list of spexus service capabilities via the initialize method, so that I can see all available tools, resources, prompts, and system instructions.  
**Source:** US-044

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends an initialize request, THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL return a JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant response with all required fields  
   _Requirements: REQ-033, REQ-034_
2. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL include protocolVersion field with value '2025-03-26' in the response  
   _Requirements: REQ-027_
3. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL include serverInfo object with name 'spexus mcp', title 'MCP server for requirements management system', and version '1.0.0'  
   _Requirements: REQ-029_
4. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL include capabilities object containing prompts, resources, and tools sections  
   _Requirements: REQ-030, REQ-035_
5. WHERE capabilities are declared, THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL set listChanged property to true for prompts, resources, and tools sections  
   _Requirements: REQ-030, REQ-035_

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an MCP client developer, I want the initialize response to follow JSON-RPC 2.0 specification exactly, so that my client can properly parse and validate the response.  
**Source:** US-044

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL include jsonrpc field with value '2.0' in every initialize response  
   _Requirements: REQ-032_
2. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL include id field that matches exactly the id from the request  
   _Requirements: REQ-031_
3. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL include result object containing all response data  
   _Requirements: REQ-033, REQ-034_
4. IF an error occurs, THEN THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL return proper JSON-RPC 2.0 error response instead of result  
   _Requirements: REQ-032_
5. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL ensure response is valid JSON format  
   _Requirements: REQ-032, REQ-033_

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent using MCP, I want to receive system instructions through the initialize method, so that I understand how to properly interact with the spexus system.  
**Source:** US-044

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL include instructions field as a string in the initialize response  
   _Requirements: REQ-028_
2. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL provide comprehensive system prompt content in the instructions field  
   _Requirements: REQ-028_
3. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL include guidance on available tools and their usage in instructions  
   _Requirements: REQ-028_
4. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL include information about resource access patterns in instructions  
   _Requirements: REQ-028_
5. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL update instructions content when server capabilities change  
   _Requirements: REQ-028_

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to discover all available server capabilities through the capabilities object, so that I can determine what features are supported.  
**Source:** US-044

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL include capabilities object with prompts, resources, and tools sections  
   _Requirements: REQ-030, REQ-035_
2. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL set listChanged to true for prompts, resources, and tools capabilities  
   _Requirements: REQ-030, REQ-035_
3. WHERE resources capability is declared, THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL optionally include subscribe property set to true  
   _Requirements: REQ-035_
4. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL ensure capabilities accurately reflect actual server functionality  
   _Requirements: REQ-030, REQ-034_
5. THE spexus_mcp_server SHALL maintain consistency between declared capabilities and available features  
   _Requirements: REQ-030, REQ-034_
